    <h3>Steamed chicken with mugwort</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A small fowl or black chicken</li>
        <li>100g fresh mugwort</li>
        <li>Some red dried apple, goji berries and lotus seed (all optinal)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparing the Chicken</li>
        <p>After plucking the chicken thoroughly, 
            clean off any remaining fine feathers, especially around the tail, wings, and neck. Rub the chicken with salt to remove any odors. <br> 
            You can stew the whole chicken, but if you want it to cook faster, cut it into bite-sized pieces.</p>
        <li>Marinating the Chicken</li>
        <p>Whether you're making chicken stewed with mugwort or any other stewed chicken dish, marinating is essential. This step enhances the flavor compared to seasoning during cooking. <br>
        After cutting the chicken, blanch it briefly in boiling water with some ginger to remove the smell, then take it out. Marinate the blanched chicken with a bit of salt and sugar. For a richer flavor, you can add fish sauce. <br> 
        Let the chicken marinate for about 15 minutes to absorb the seasonings. During cooking, the natural sweetness released from the chicken will enrich the flavor of the soup.</p>
        <li>Preparing the Other Ingredients</li>  
        <p>Scrape the skin off the ginger and slice it. <br> 
        Use only the young leaves and tips of the mugwort plant to keep the broth mildly bitter, not too strong. Soak the mugwort in diluted salt water to remove dirt and toxins, then drain. <br>
        Soak red dates, goji berries, and codonopsis root in cold water for about 15 minutes. Rinse to remove any dust, blanch them briefly in boiling water, then rinse once more and drain. </p>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <p>After preparing all the ingredients, follow these steps to make the chicken stewed with mugwort and herbal medicine: <br>
        Place the marinated chicken in a pan and stir-fry briefly until the skin firms up. Then, add the red dates, goji berries, codonopsis root, and sliced ginger, and stir-fry everything for about 1 minute before pouring in water to fill the pot.<br>
        Once the water comes to a boil, use a spoon to skim off any foam to keep the broth clear and visually appealing. Next, add the mugwort leaves and continue stewing the chicken for about 1 hour.<br>
        Halfway through the cooking, taste the broth. If it's not flavorful enough, you can add a bit more salt.</p>
