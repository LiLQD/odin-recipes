    <h3>Braised Carp with Galangal</h3>
    <h4>ngredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg Carp</li>
        <li>2 large galangal roots</li>
        <li>1 ginger root</li>
        <li>Fish sauce, sugar, seasoning powder</li>
        <li>Fresh tea leaf (optinal)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the carp thoroughly and cut it into thick slices. Wash the galangal and ginger, then slice them thinly. Wash the fresh tea leaves, place half of them at the bottom of the pot, and steep the other half in hot water.</li>
        <li>Layer the ingredients in the pot: first a layer of tea leaves, then a layer of galangal, followed by ginger. Place the fish slices on top to cover the pot, then add another layer of galangal and ginger on top.</li>
        <li>In a small pan, add about 2 tablespoons of sugar and stir continuously until the sugar melts and turns a caramel color. Pour this caramel over the surface of the fish.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix about half a bowl of fish sauce, seasoning powder, and 1/2 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well until dissolved, then pour over the fish. Cook on the stove for about 5 minutes to let the fish absorb the flavors.
            <br> While cooking, tilt the pot gently so the sauce can soak evenly into the fish.</li>
        <li>Pour the steeped tea into the pot, just enough to cover the surface of the fish. Bring to a boil, then reduce to very low heat and simmer until the liquid reduces and the fish takes on a caramel color.</li>
    </ol>
