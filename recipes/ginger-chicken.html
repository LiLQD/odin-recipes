    <h3>Stir fry chicken with ginger</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 free-range chicken (about 800–900 grams)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of finely minced ginger and shallots</li>
        <li>Fish sauce, salt, pepper, cooking oil</li>
        <li>Red chili (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the chicken, rub it with coarse salt and lemon to remove any odor, rinse well, pat dry, and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, mix the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 tablespoon fish sauce, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon seasoning powder. <br> 
            Let it marinate for 8–10 minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan. Add 1 tablespoon of minced shallots and 1/2 tablespoon of shredded ginger, and sauté until fragrant</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pan and stir-fry over high heat. Stir well to ensure the chicken cooks evenly and doesn't stick to the pan</li>
        <li>When the chicken firms up and the sauce in the pan thickens and reduces, add another 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, 1 teaspoon of seasoning powder, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, <br> and chili if you prefer spicy food. Stir well to combine, then turn off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
